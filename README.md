# Automation for World Language Games
Are you tired of doing your World Language Games? Do you wish you had a tool to do them for you? Well, now your wish has come true!

These scripts will automate the playthrough of their respective games.
There are also some other tools, which do things like select your name automatically and let you play disabled games.

## Games I've automated so far:
- Millions (Adds random time between *1:00* and *4:59* and a random amount of wrong guesses between *0* and *4* for extra realism!)
- Basketball
- Ping-Pong (Ultra realistic, actually **plays the game** for you, takes a bit of time but is completely undetectable, even if the teacher is looking over your shoulder)

## Tools I've made so far:
- Name Auto-select (COMING SOON)
- Disabled Games Launcher (COMING SOON)

I hope they come in handy for you.
